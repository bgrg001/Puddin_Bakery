# A Slice of Sin

## Description 
_____________________________________________________________________________
I am creating a website inspired by a new, indepedent bakery in the town I grew up in. All bakes are homemade and they are very popular in the town. The website I would like to create involves information about the bakery, an order form which registrers the information at the back end and when submitting says acknowledges receipt of the order. A table is created to show what has been recorded.
